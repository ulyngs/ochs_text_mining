This is an example of how to do text mining with the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, in versions downloaded from GRETIL.

# Read in text
```{r}
texts <- read_csv("data_processed/texts_combined_line_by_line.csv") %>% 
  select(-text)
```

Great, let's have a look at how many lines we have from each

```{r}
texts %>% 
  count(document)
```

# Term frequencies & tf-idf
## Term frequency
Here's an example of doing this manually.
We first split the text up into single words, using the 'unnest_tokens' function.

```{r}
text_tokenise_by_word <- texts %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text_clean)

# save it out so we can read in the result quickly in the dashboard example
text_tokenise_by_word %>% 
  write_csv("data_processed/texts_tokenised_by_words.csv")
```

Then we count how many times each word occurs; count the total number of words in each text; then calculate the term frequencies

```{r}
text_word_counts <- text_tokenise_by_word %>%
  count(document, word, sort = TRUE)

total_words <- text_word_counts %>% 
  group_by(document) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n))

text_term_frequencies <- text_word_counts %>% 
  left_join(total_words) %>% 
  mutate(term_frequency = n / total)

# write out so we can read in quickly in dashboard example
text_term_frequencies %>% 
  write_csv("data_processed/text_term_frequencies.csv")

```

Let's visualise this in a bar chart

```{r}
text_term_frequencies %>% 
  group_by(document) %>% 
  arrange(desc(term_frequency)) %>% 
  slice(1:20) %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, term_frequency, document)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = reorder(word, term_frequency), y = term_frequency, fill = document)) + 
    coord_flip() +
    facet_wrap(~document, scales = "free") +
    labs(x = "", y = "Term frequency") +
    scale_x_reordered()
  
```

# Tf-idf
```{r}
word_tf_idf <- text_word_counts %>% 
  bind_tf_idf(word, document, n)

word_tf_idf %>% 
  group_by(document) %>% 
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>% 
  slice(1:20) %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, tf_idf, document)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = reorder(word, tf_idf), y = tf_idf, fill = document)) +
    facet_wrap(~document, scales = "free") +
    coord_flip() +
    scale_x_reordered()
    
ggsave("words_tf_idf.png", height = 6, width = 10)
```


# n-grams
## Split text up into bigrams
```{r}
text_bigrams <- texts %>% 
  unnest_tokens(bigrams, text_clean, token = "ngrams", n = 2)

bigram_counts <- text_bigrams %>% 
  count(bigrams, document, sort = TRUE)
```


## Add tf-idf
```{r}
bigram_tf_idf <- bigram_counts %>% 
  bind_tf_idf(bigrams, document, n)

bigram_tf_idf %>% 
  group_by(document) %>% 
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>% 
  slice(1:20) %>% 
  mutate(bigrams = reorder_within(bigrams, tf_idf, document)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = reorder(bigrams, tf_idf), y = tf_idf, fill = document)) + 
    coord_flip() +
    facet_wrap(~document, scales = "free") +
    labs( x = "", title = "tf-idf on bigrams") +
    scale_x_reordered()


```
